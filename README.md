**AIPoPh** is an innovative proof of humanity (PoH) system developed by NEWM, aimed at bolstering the security of smart contracts. This protocol integrates traditional approaches with cryptographic proofs and machine learning techniques to ensure that users are genuine humans rather than advanced AI entities.

This research project has been funded as a proposal under the Catalyst program, specifically for the 10th funding round in the `Open Source Dev Ecosystem` category.

## Goals

The main goals of the Proof-of-Human (PoH) system for smart contracts are:

1. **Enhancing Security**: Secure the Cardano ecosystem by ensuring only verified human users interact with smart contracts, reducing the potential for fraudulent activities and manipulations by bots or malevolent entities.

2. **Promoting User Confidence**: By introducing an additional layer of security through the PoH system, we aim to boost user confidence in the Cardano ecosystem, paving the way for wider adoption.

3. **Preserving User Privacy**: As we implement the PoH system, our utmost priority is to comply with privacy standards and regulations. This not only safeguards users' rights but also fortifies the trust they place in our system.
