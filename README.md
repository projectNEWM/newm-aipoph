**AIPoPh** is an innovative proof of humanity (PoH) system developed by NEWM, aimed at bolstering the security of smart contracts. This protocol integrates traditional approaches with cryptographic proofs and machine learning techniques to ensure that users are genuine humans rather than advanced AI entities.

This research project has been funded as a proposal under the Catalyst program, specifically for the 10th funding round in the `Open Source Dev Ecosystem` category.
